# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Simplified

This repository consists my explainations to the common data structures and algorithms. After the main topics are covered, the repository will be updated with competitive programming questions. This is my effort to contribute to the open source education of computer science.
The repository will be constantly updated with new files. 


The project is open sourced and you are free to use any of the material without any permission.
If you find any bug or an issue, feel free to contact me via my email address pamanalionline@gmail.com .
