The purpose of this document is to understand as to what is the reason behind having advanced data structures 
like trees, graphs and heaps. But before going to that. Let us first evaluate the simple data structures and its progression. 

1) Arrays: Its simple to implement. But is not resizable. that effects the efficiency. And many operations are O(n).

2) Linked List : Resizable, simple to implement. But search operations are not time efficient. 

3) Hash Sets : Hashsts are simple, and even the information retrival is faster. But we will not have the track of the order
in which the data is fed into the data structure. 

Motivation for Advanced Data Structures:

1) A solution for having a simple data entry solution.

2) A solution for preserving the order of data entry. 

3) A solution for having the relationships between the data that are already existing in the data structure. 

In this directory, the Advanced Data Structures are discussed.
